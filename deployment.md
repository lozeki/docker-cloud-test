I was surprised about almost everythings on the posts. Everything is working automatic and it is fine without human.
All of the companys use the progress are similar with others. But some of them develop them and some use the tools from other sources.
The post from codeship is most easy to understand because it is about docker and test and so on.
Develop may post the similar code and all pass the test, I really wonder what will happen to those codes.
