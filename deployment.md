1. First, I install Flask and other environments on the server. The Dockerfile is a important file, I had a lot of problem with it.

2. I used python on the app code, but I am not good ai it. The professor already did the code and I just need to understand what the code do.

3. The run and test process. I need to makesure the result when run unh698.py is the same with the thing that I expect on unh698test.py when we execute it from run_tests.sh.

4. I used the key and IP from professor to connect to AWS instance and install docker github. I still couldn't make the image run on the background.
